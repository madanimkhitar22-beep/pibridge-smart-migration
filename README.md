# PiBridge – Smart Migration

**PiBridge – Smart Migration** is a **secure, AI-powered migration infrastructure** designed to automate **asset transfers, KYC validation, and reputation synchronization** between the **Pi Network** and external blockchains.  
It operates under governance control and institutional safeguards, ensuring **full transparency, traceability, and quantum-grade security**.

This project is officially aligned with the [**PiTrust Protocol**](https://github.com/madanimkhitar22-beep/PiTrust-Infrastructure-Protocol), forming part of a unified Moroccan-built framework for decentralized trust, auditability, and global interoperability.

## 🔐 Core Features

- **🧠 Smart Migration Engine:**  
  Secure, AI-driven process for transferring verified assets between Pi Network and BSC (and other compatible chains) with full traceability.

- **🛑 Emergency Governance Stop:**  
  An on-chain mechanism that allows the PiTrust council or governance DAO to suspend operations during anomalies, threats, or policy changes.

- **🪙 Identity-Linked Verification (via PiTrust):**  
  Every migration request passes through **PiTrust Attestation** for identity, KYC, and trust-level verification before execution.

- **📜 Audit-Ready Architecture:**  
  Every component is designed for third-party audits, regulatory compliance, and verifiable traceability.

## 🧩 System Architecture

User → PiBridge Gateway → PiTrust Attestation → Migration Engine → Mainnet/BSC

### Process Overview:
1. **User:** Initiates a migration or verification request.  
2. **PiBridge Gateway:** Entry layer that validates credentials and encrypts migration data.  
3. **PiTrust Attestation:** Performs KYC, identity verification, and trust validation.  
4. **Migration Engine:** Executes cross-chain transfer while logging all events on-chain.  
5. **Mainnet/BSC:** Final destination where validated assets or reputation data are committed securely.  

This pipeline ensures **end-to-end accountability**, **zero data leakage**, and **governance-level reliability**.

## 🏛️ Governance & Institutional Model

PiBridge operates under the **PiTrust institutional governance framework**, ensuring that every update, parameter, and smart contract change is:

- **Community-reviewed** through transparent voting.  
- **Documented** with changelogs and version signatures.  
- **Audited** for compliance and security integrity.  
- **Aligned** with Pi Network’s decentralization and trust values.  

All governance decisions are published in **public logs** for accountability and transparency.
